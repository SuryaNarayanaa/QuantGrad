# Project README

This project contains multiple sub-projects. You can find their respective README files below:

- [Derivatives README](./Derivatives/README.md)
- [QuantGrad README](./QuantGrad/README.md)
- This is how a 100 parameter FC NN looks like, pretty dope
![This is how a 100 parameter FC NN looks like](./This%20is%20how%20a%20100%20parameter%20FC%20NN%20looks%20like%20.svg)

As this is the building blocks of DNN's and AI's we can experiment with a lot of concepts with this, 
So collaborators are welcomed to clone this and try experimenting with this.
